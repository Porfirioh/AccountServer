## Customers

### Listing

The Customers Listing lists all customers who have an outstanding balance by default. You can change it to list all customers by clicking *Show All* (and change it back by clicking *Outstanding only*). Click on a customer to select it.

### Customer Detail

When you have clicked on a customer, you see the Customer Detail screen. This shows all outstanding invoices (and credit notes and payments) for the customer. You can change it to list all invoices by clicking *Show All*. Click on an invoice, credit note or payment to display it.

### Adding and amending Invoices and Credit Memos

Click New Invoice or New Credit Memo to create a new one. Or choose an existing one from the customer listing.

Type the customer name in the customer field. As you type, a drop down of existing customers with similar names appears, which you can click on to choose one. If you type a new customer name in, when you leave the field you will be asked if you want to create a new customer, and then you can type in their address. If you choose an existing customer, the invoice address field will automatically be filled from the customer record, although you can overwrite it if the invoice is to go to a different address (but that won't update the customer record).

Check the date is correct (the default date is today).

Number the invoice - you can either type in your own invoice number, or press the *Next* button - the next unused invoice number will be assigned when you save the invoice.

The Memo field appears on the printed invoice, and can be used for any message you want to send the customer.

Now add the invoice lines - for each line, choose a product - that will fill the Memo field with the product description, unit price and VAT code. Enter the Quantity (in whatever Unit you have chosen for the product), and the line amount will be calculated. You can overwrite the Memo field with different text if you like. As you enter each new line, a new blank line will appear below. You can delete an existing line by pressing the red ![x](AccountServer/images/close.png).

Note that the total and VAT total are updated automatically as you amend the lines.

When you have finished entering the invoice, press *Save*, and new options will appear to *Print**, *Print to file*, and *Email* the invoice. Or press *Save and Close*, or *Save and New* if you want to create multiple invoices without printing any yet.

*Print to file* will download a copy of the invoice (in html format, which can be opened in any web browser). 

*Email* will send the invoice to the customer's email address (if they have one on file).
