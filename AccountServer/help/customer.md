# Customers

## Listing

The Customers Listing lists all customers who have an outstanding balance by default. You can change it to list all customers by clicking *Show All* (and change it back by clicking *Outstanding only*). Click on a customer to select it.

## Customer Detail

When you have clicked on a customer, you see the Customer Detail screen. This shows all outstanding invoices (and credit notes and payments) - documents - for the customer. You can change it to list all documents by clicking *Show All*. Click on a document to display it.

## Invoices and Credit Memos

Click New Invoice or New Credit Memo to create a new one. Or choose an existing one from the customer listing to edit it.

Type the customer name in the customer field. As you type, a drop down of existing customers with similar names appears, which you can click on to choose one. If you type a new customer name in, when you leave the field you will be asked if you want to create a new customer, and then you can type in their address. If you choose an existing customer, the invoice address field will automatically be filled from the customer record, although you can overwrite it if the invoice is to go to a different address (but that won't update the customer record).

Check the date is correct (the default date is today).

Number the invoice - you can either type in your own invoice number, or press the *Next* button - the next unused invoice number will be assigned when you save the invoice.

The Memo field appears on the printed invoice, and can be used for any message you want to send the customer.

Now add the invoice lines - for each line, choose a product - that will fill the Memo field with the product description, unit price and VAT code. Enter the Quantity (in whatever Unit you have chosen for the product), and the line amount will be calculated. You can overwrite the Memo field with different text if you like. As you enter each new line, a new blank line will appear below. You can delete an existing line by pressing the red ![x](../images/close.png).

Note that the total and VAT total are updated automatically as you amend the lines.

When you have finished entering the invoice, press *Save*, and new options will appear to *Print*, *Print to file*, and *Email* the invoice. Or press *Save and Close*, or *Save and New* if you want to create multiple invoices without printing any yet.

*Print* opens a new window with a print-ready version of the invoice, and opens the print dialog to print it to the printer of your choice.

*Print to file* will download a copy of the invoice (in html format, which can be opened in any web browser). 

*Email* will send the invoice to the customer's email address (if they have one on file).

## Payments

When a customer pays you for one or more invoices, use the *Customers* *New Payment* screen. Select the required customer from the dropdown. The customer address and phone number will be filled in, and a list of all outstanding invoices and credit notes will appear.

Then enter the bank account into which the payment arrived. Check the date is correct, and enter the payment amount. 

Now allocate the payment to the invoices paid, by ticking the invoices. Note that, if the invoice is greater than the amount of the payment remaining, the amount paid against that invoice will be reduced (and a message to that effect appears at the top of the page). If you tick a credit memo, the amount to be allocated will increase.

Note - if you have a credit note you want to allocate to an invoice, you can create a Payment of zero, and tick the credit note and the invoice (in that order).

## Amending a document that has been allocated

By default, only documents that have not been fully allocated appear in the Customer Detail screen - however, if you click *Show All* at the top left, you can see all the documents, and click on one to edit it.
