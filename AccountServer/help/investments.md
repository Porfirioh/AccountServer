# Investments

Investments include pensions, loans to other people, and stocks and shares accounts (e.g. with a stockbroker). Investment accounts may be plain accounts (as for a pension), or may hold both cash and securities (e.g. shares and unit trusts) which vary in value from day to day.

## Listing

This lists all the investment accounts you have. Each account has a cash balance, and a value, which is the value of the any secutities held at today's price.

To add a new one, click *New Account*.

## Securities

Securities lists all the securities you have traded in so far. Click on one to display the details and prices.

## Updating prices

When you display a security, all the prices you have input so far (most recent first). You can amend or delete prices, or add a new one by clicking *New price*. This adds a row with today's date - input the price - it will be saved when you press *Save* or *Save and Close*.

## Adding transactions

You can transfer money into or out of your investment accounts using a Transfer from another account, or make deposits or pay out cheques, just like a bank account. 

You can also make a *Balance adjustment*, which is useful for an account, like a pension, where the value may change due to gain (or loss) - all you have to do is enter the new value from the provider's statement, and a transaction will be added to account for the change.

You can also Buy and Sell securities from the account. When entering a buy or sell transaction the important fields are:

|Field|Comment|
|-----|-------|
|Security Name|Type the name of the security you are buying or selling. As you type, a drop down of existing securities with similar names appears, which you can click on to choose one. If you type a new security name in, when you leave the field you will be asked if you want to create a new one - when you save the transaction, a new security will be created with the price set to that in the transaction.|
|Quantity|How many of the shares you are buying or selling.|
|Price|The price per share. Note - if this is a new buy/sell, a price will automatically be added to the security for the date of the transaction.|
|Fee account|The general ledger account to which to post any fees.|
|Fee|The amount of any transaction fees.|
