This checks the integrity of all your data in the database, including:
* Every document balances
* Each customer and supplier's invoices, payments and amount outstanding balances
* Every document has all the journals required
* Member and name and address records match

## Backup and Restore

Backup backs up your database to a json file, and downloads it so you can store it on your computer (or email it to someone).

Restore restores the database from a backup file - **this will overwrite all your data with the old data**.
