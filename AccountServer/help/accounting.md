# Accounting

## Listing

This lists all the general ledger accounts. These are used to analyse your transaction lines into categories. Click on an account to see the details.

Click *New Account" to create a new one. Each account must have a unique name, and must be assigned to a Type. The account types available are shown in the order in which they appear in the Profit and Loss account.

## Account Detail

This shows all the postings to the account (most recent first). You can click on a posting to be taken to the relevant document.

## Adding journals

## Names

*Names* lets you edit the list of names you have used in journals or banking transactions (other than customers, suppliers or members). Click on a name to edit it. This list is used to produce the drop-down list of names like the one you type when choosing a name for a journal. If you have a lot of names which appear on that list, but are no longer useful, you can edit them, and check the hidden box to prevent them appearing on the list in future. Hidden names don't appear on the Names list by default, but you can reveal them again by clicking the *Show all* button (perhaps to edit one, and unhide it).

## VAT Return

Clicking on *VAT Return* will check all your VATable transactions which haven't been included on a VAT Return yet, up to the end of the last VAT quarter, and produce a standard VAT Return for you to submit to the government. 

Note that the VAT quarters are determined by your declared year start date in *Admin* *Settings*.

Once you are happy that everything is corrent, choose the payment date and bank account, and click *Save and Print*. All the transactions included will be marked as VAT paid, the payment will be added to the chosen bank account, and you can print out the VAT return.

If you want to see a previous VAT Return, select it from the *Other VAT returns* dropdown at the bottom.

If you want to see the details of every transaction that goes up to make the various figures, print the *VAT Detail Report* under *Reports*.
