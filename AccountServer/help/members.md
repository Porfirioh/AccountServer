# Members

## Listing

The Members Listing lists all members who have not left . You can change it to list all members by clicking *Include left members* (and change it back by clicking *Current members only*). Click on a member to select it, or click *Add member* to add a new one.

## Membership Types

Membership types must be set up first, at least one for each annual subscription amount. If subscription payments are spread throughout the year, enter the number of payments (e.g. 12 for monthly payments).

## Member Detail

Each member must have a unique membership number, and type (see *Membership Types* below). When you select a membership type, the Payment amount, Amount Due and Annual Subscription will be updated from the Membership Type record. However, you can change the payment amount and amount due if you wish - e.g. if someone joins part way through a year, and you do not wish to charge them the full yearly fee.

## Subscription Payments

These are used to receive subscription payments from one or more members. 

Click *New Subscription Payment" to create a new one. Or choose an existing one from the *Subscription Payments* listing.

Choose the bank account into which the money has been paid.

Now add the members - for each line, type the member name or number - as you type, a drop down of existing members with similar names or numbers appears, which you must click on to choose one. Then the payment amount will be filled in from the memebr record (but you can change it if you wish). As you enter each new line, a new blank line will appear below. You can delete an existing line by pressing the red ![x](../../images/close.png).

Note that the total amount is updated automatically as you amend the lines.

When you have finished entering the payment, press *Save* or *Save and Close*, the membership records will be updated to reflect the amounts paid, and the payment will be added to the bank account.
