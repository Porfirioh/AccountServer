## Summary

The Summary on the Home screen gives you a summary of your accounts. It contains your To do list for the next 7 days, then a summary of the balances in each of your bank accounts and credit cards, a list of unpaid invoices to customers, a list of unpaid supplier invoices, a list of the current values of all your investments, and finally your net worth.

To action a To do item, click on the checkbox next to it.

## To Do list

The To Do list contains memorised transactions (items which happen at regular intervals, which you have chosen to automate), and to do notes (which you can add with *Home*/*New To Do*). 

You can amend or delete To Do items with *Home*/*To Do* - this shows a list of all your To Do items. Click on one to select it. From here you can change the next date, repeat type and frequency, and the task description. If Repeat Type is Weekly, and Frequency is 4, the item will be repeated every 4 weeks. If the item is a memorised transaction, you can also click *Post Doc* to post the transaction to the database. If it is merely a reminder, click *Job Done* to mark it as complete.
