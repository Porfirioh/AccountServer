# Reports

Reports are divided into 4 headings.

* Memorised reports are specific reports you have customised and memorised to run again (with the latest data).
* Standard reports are the standard accounting reports.
* Lists show lists of records. Note there are no Customers or Suppliers lists - use the Names list, but set a filter for only Customers or Suppliers. If you do this, you may want to memorise the changed report.
* Audit reports show all the changes that have been made to records over a selected time period.

## Modifying a report

Initially a report displays with default settings. Click *Modify report* to change these - you can change the title of the report, which fields are included, the date range, filter which records are included, and set sorting and totalling.

If you change any of this information, and then close the report, you will be warned that your changes will be lost unless you memorise the report.

## Memorising a report

If you are likely to want to run this report with these modifications again, click *Memorise* - the modified report will be added to the memorised reports list. Note that memorised reports must all have unique names - you will get an error message if you try to save a report with the same name as a different memorised report.

If you change the name of an existing memorised report, you will be asked to confirm whether you want to update the existing report, or add a new one.

## Drill-down

With many standard reports, you can click on a line in the report to see the details that go to make up that line, or to the relevant transaction.

## Audit reports

Audit reports show the changes made to the database. The *Change Type* will show either Insert, Delete or Update and Previous. For Update and Previous records, the Update is the new record, the Previous is the old record, and the changed fields are highlighted in yellow.
