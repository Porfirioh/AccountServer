# Suppliers

## Listing

The Suppliers Listing lists all customers who have an outstanding balance by default. You can change it to list all suppliers by clicking *Show All* (and change it back by clicking *Outstanding only*). Click on a supplier to select it.

## Supplier Detail

When you have clicked on a supplier, you see the Supplier Detail screen. This shows all outstanding invoices (and credit notes and payments)- documents - for the supplier. You can change it to list all documents by clicking *Show All*. Click on a document to display it.

## Bills & Credits

Click New Bill or New Credit to create a new one. Or choose an existing one from the supplier listing.

Type the supplier name in the supplier field. As you type, a drop down of existing suppliers with similar names appears, which you can click on to choose one. If you type a new supplier name in, when you leave the field you will be asked if you want to create a new supplier, and then you can type in their address. If you choose an existing supplier, the address field will automatically be filled from the supplier record, although you can overwrite it if the invoice is from a different address (but that won't update the supplier record). Also, the lines from the last invoice from that supplier will be copied in, which you can amend or delete as appropriate.

Check the date is correct (the default date is today).

Number the invoice - you can either type in your own invoice number, or press the *Next* button - the next unused invoice number will be assigned when you save the invoice.

Now add the invoice lines - for each line, choose an account. Enter the Vat Code and Amount. Note that you can overwrite the calculated VAT if the supplier has calculated the VAT differently (perhaps they use a different rounding method). You can add a note to the line in the Memo field if you like. As you enter each new line, a new blank line will appear below. You can delete an existing line by pressing the red ![x](../../images/close.png).

Note that the total and VAT total are updated automatically as you amend the lines.

## Bill Payments

To pay one or more supplier invoices, use the *Suppliers* *New Bill Payment* screen. Select the required supplier from the dropdown. The supplier address and phone number will be filled in, and a list of all outstanding invoices and credit notes will appear.

Then enter the bank account from which to make the payment. Check the date is correct. 

Now choose the invoices to pay, by ticking the invoices - this will add each invoice to the amount to pay. If you tick a credit, the amount to pay will obviously reduce. If you want to only part pay an invoice, reduce the Amount Paid against that invoice.

Note - if you have a credit note you want to allocate to an invoice, you can create a Bill Payment of zero, and tick the credit note and the invoice.

## Amending a document that has been allocated

By default, only documents that have not been fully allocated appear in the Supplier Detail screen - however, if you click *Show All* at the top left, you can see all the documents, and click on one to edit it.
