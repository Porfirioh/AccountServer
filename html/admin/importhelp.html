<p>You can import any of the types of comma-delimited or tab-delimited files listed below.</p>
<p>If the system returns a message "No importer for file", this means the file does not
have all the fields listed below.</p>
<p>You can also import QIF files - but you should have transactions for all your accounts in a
single file, because if you use a separate file for each account, transfers between accounts in
different files will appear twice.</p>
<h4>Importing from Quick Books</h4>
<p class="warning">Quick books does not show the full name of sub-accounts in its reports. It
is therefore essential that you edit any subaccounts to give them unique names.
E.g. rename the Taxes subaccount under Payroll to Payroll/Taxes.</p>
<p>To transfer data from Quick Books, you only need 2 files.</p>
<p>Use File, Utilites, Export to produce an IIF File - if you tick all the boxes,
you can create a single file containing most of your data. The only other data
you will need is a Custom Transaction Detail Report for the transactions. Customize the report,
make sure all the fields listed below are selected, select All dates, run the report and then
print it to a tab-delimited file.</p>
<p>When importing, import your IIF Import File first, then go to Admin, Settings
in this accounts package, and make sure everything is filled in, especially your financial year
start - this is vital to ensure your VAT payments are matched correctly.</p>
<p>Finally, import your Transaction Detail Report.</p>
<p>Note that there is currently no way of importing payment history from Quick Books.</p>
